;
;  Striping setup
;
;  These parameters have only effect when Striping is set to 1 in the
;  [Database] section, in which case the DatabaseFile parameter is ignored.
;
;  With striping, the database is spawned across multiple segments
;  where each segment can have multiple stripes.
;
;  Format of the lines below:
;    Segment<number> = <size>, <stripe file name> [, <stripe file name> .. ]
;
;  <number> must be ordered from 1 up.
;
;  The <size> is the total size of the segment which is equally divided
;  across all stripes forming  the segment. Its specification can be in
;  gigabytes (g), megabytes (m), kilobytes (k) or in database blocks
;  (b, the default)
;
;  Note that the segment size must be a multiple of the database page size
;  which is currently 8k. Also, the segment size must be divisible by the
;  number of stripe files forming  the segment.
;
;  The example below creates a 200 meg database striped on two segments
;  with two stripes of 50 meg and one of 100 meg.
;
;  You can always add more segments to the configuration, but once
;  added, do not change the setup.
